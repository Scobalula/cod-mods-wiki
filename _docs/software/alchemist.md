# Alchemist

Alchemist is an app that allows you to easily bake viewmodel animations from games that utilize pose animations and IK for grips, stocks, etc. It can also be used for generating sprint, slides, etc. from games that utilize "gesture" animations. This makes it easy to port these animations to games that require unique per-attachment animation sets.
